# Hand Gesture Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)

## Overview
This repository contains code and resources for developing a hand gesture recognition model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). The project was completed as part of an internship, focusing on Task 4.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the [LeapGestureRecog dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gti-upm/leapgestrecog). It consists of diverse hand gestures captured from image and video data, providing a comprehensive set for training and evaluation.

## Task Description
- Implemented a CNN model to recognize and classify various hand gestures for intuitive human-computer interaction.
- Trained the model on the LeapGestureRecog dataset to ensure accurate classification of gestures.
- Evaluated the model's performance using appropriate metrics and techniques.

## Key Takeaways
- Deepened understanding of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and their applications in computer vision tasks.
- Explored techniques for preprocessing image and video data to enhance model performance.
- Learned about gesture recognition algorithms and their potential for revolutionizing human-computer interaction.

## Project Notebook
- The project notebook is available as a PDF file for a detailed overview of the implementation.
